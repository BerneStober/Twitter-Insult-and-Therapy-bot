# Twitter-Insult-and-Therapy-bot
This bot provides Joe Biden level insults with both a block and no block option.  It also provides an Eliza therapy option. 

You will need to get Twitter API credentials <- try googling that for instructions.  Twitter may require you have a website, 
but I was able to just give them a spoofed website, which they accepted. Your credentials will have to be put into the create_api 
module. 
In the main code module, you should read through the comments because there are places there where you will have to enter your
screen name and some other information about your twitter account like a tweet id. 
I advise you to have a second account to use for testing the bot and seeing how it responds.  I did this during the writing 
and debugging of the bot.

I hopy you enjoy this and if you happen to extend the functionality, please do hsare it with the Github community.
